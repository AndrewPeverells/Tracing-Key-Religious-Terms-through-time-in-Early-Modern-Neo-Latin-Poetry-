## Tracing Key Religious Terms Through Time in Early Modern Neo-Latin Poetry

This repository contains the datasets, metadata, and pipeline used for the project “Tracing Key Religious Terms Through Time in Early Modern Neo-Latin Poetry.”
The goal of this study is to examine how the semantics and contextual associations of major theological concepts — most centrally gratia and fides — changed across time, place, and confessional background in early modern Latin poetry of the German lands (15th–19th c.).

The repository includes:

- A curated and cleaned corpus derived from the CAMENA – Corpus Automatum Multiplex Electorum Neolatinitatis Auctorum (University of Mannheim), redistributed under the terms of the CC BY-SA 4.0 license;

- Enriched metadata for authors, printers, places, and publication dates;

- Scripts for text extraction, preprocessing, metadata alignment, and collocate statistics for implementing semantic drift analysis and diachronic collocate evolution;

- Visualisations of term trajectories across time periods and confessional contexts.
